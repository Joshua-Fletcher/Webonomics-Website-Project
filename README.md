# Webonomics-Website-Project
<br>

A website I made for a startup company named Webonomics using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the site is to allow the users to purchase their community token and display some of their ideas. The website is fully responsive and has some interactive elements such as a light and dark mode.
